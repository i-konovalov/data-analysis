# Description
This is a repository of notebooks with my data analysis projects.
***
### Structure
Each project is a separate repository folder.  
There are 2 files in each folder: a notebook with a project and a README with a description of the project.
### What technologies are used in the projects
**Languages:** `Python`, `SQL`.  
**Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels`, `SQLAlchemy`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `Re`, `Pymystem3`.
### What are these projects?
I started my way into data analysis with the Yandex.Practicum course. Every 2 weeks, we, the students of the course, carried out projects using the tools we learned. As a result, I got 11 notebooks which are presented here. Also I added some other side projects.

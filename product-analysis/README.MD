# Product Analysis for Event Ticket sales service
### Task
To analyze site logs, calculate business metrics and suggest changes to the marketing budget.
### What I used
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
### Plan
1. Preprocess the data.
2. Divide users into cohorts.
3. Calculate metrics:
   - DAU, WAU, MAU;
   - ASL;
   - Retention rate;
   - Average time from the first visit to the purchase;
   - Average number of orders per user;
   - ARPU;
   - LTV, CAC, ROMI.
4. Offer recommendations for optimizing the marketing budget.
### What I did
Brought the data to the right types, checked for errors and outliers. First, I calculated the general metrics, then divided the users into cohorts and calculated the user metrics (RR, LTV, ROI, etc.), wrote several visualization functions, described the principle of operation inside them. To create the integrity of the narrative, I completed the project in a single style and color scheme.

In the end, I summed up the conclusions and proposed optimization of the advertising budget.
